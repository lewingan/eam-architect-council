# Reliability & Asset Management Standards Map

Use these standards as anchors when recommendations need external authority.

## Core
- ISO 55000/55001/55002: asset management system principles and requirements.
- ISO 14224: reliability/maintenance data taxonomy and collection.
- SAE JA1011/JA1012: RCM evaluation criteria and guidance.
- SMRP metrics framework: maintenance/reliability KPI structure.

## Conditional by Industry
- NFPA 70B: electrical maintenance programs.
- API 580/581: risk-based inspection for process industries.
- OSHA 1910.147 (LOTO), OSHA PSM 1910.119: safety and mechanical integrity contexts.
- FDA 21 CFR Part 211: GMP-oriented maintenance constraints in pharma.

## How to Cite in Answers
- Name the standard and the decision it informs.
- Keep claims practical (process, data, governance), not legal advice.
