# KPI Definitions and Benchmark Ranges

Treat all values as starting benchmarks; calibrate to asset criticality and industry.

| KPI | Formula | Typical Starting Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| PM Compliance | PMs on-time / PMs scheduled | 90-95% |
| Schedule Compliance | Scheduled work completed / scheduled planned | 80-90% |
| Planned Work Ratio | Planned hours / total maintenance hours | 70-85% |
| Wrench Time | Hands-on craft hours / total craft hours | 45-60% |
| Backlog (weeks) | Open WO hours / weekly craft capacity | 2-6 weeks |
| MTTR | Repair hours / number of repairs | trend downward |
| MTBF | Uptime / failures | trend upward |
| Maintenance Cost % RAV | annual maintenance spend / RAV | often ~2-4% |

## Usage Notes
- Use trend direction + percentile goals when hard targets are not trustworthy.
- Pair lagging KPIs (MTBF/MTTR) with leading KPIs (schedule compliance, planned work ratio).
