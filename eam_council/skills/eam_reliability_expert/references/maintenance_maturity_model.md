# Maintenance Maturity Model (Practical)

## Level 1 — Reactive
- Unplanned work dominates; PM weak or absent.
- Focus: failure code discipline, emergency triage, safety basics.

## Level 2 — Emerging
- Basic PM exists; CMMS used inconsistently.
- Focus: planner role clarity, PM quality, parts availability.

## Level 3 — Proactive
- Planned work is majority; schedule process is stable.
- Focus: criticality-based strategy, FMEA/RCM on critical assets, CBM adoption.

## Level 4 — Predictive
- Reliability engineering embedded in planning.
- Focus: condition data pipelines, predictive models, lifecycle optimization.

## Level 5 — Adaptive
- Closed-loop optimization with strong governance.
- Focus: prescriptive actions, cross-functional value realization, continuous learning.

## Transition Rule
Always define next 90-day moves, owner, KPI, and review cadence.
