# Reliability and Maintenance Formulas

## Core Reliability
- MTBF = Total Operating Time / Number of Failures
- MTTR = Total Repair Time / Number of Repairs
- Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
- Failure Rate (lambda) = 1 / MTBF

## OEE
- OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
- Availability = (Planned Time - Downtime) / Planned Time
- Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Count) / Operating Time
- Quality = Good Count / Total Count

## Criticality
- Criticality Score = Consequence × Probability
- Use 5x5 matrix to tier response intensity (run-to-fail, PM, PM+CBM, full RCM/PdM).

## FMEA
- RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection
- Common action trigger: high severity and/or high RPN threshold.

## Inventory
- Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
