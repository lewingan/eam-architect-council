# Supplemental Reliability Terms (Non-Canonical)

Use these only when terms are not present in canonical glossary; mark as provisional if adopted.

- **P-F Interval**: elapsed time from first detectable degradation to functional failure.
- **Bad Actor**: asset/problem category with disproportionate loss/failure impact.
- **Defect Elimination**: preventing recurrence by removing physical/human/systemic causes.
- **Precision Maintenance**: quality controls on installation, lubrication, alignment, balance, and torque.
- **Consequence of Failure (CoF)**: impact dimension (safety, environment, production, cost, reputation).
- **Probability of Failure (PoF)**: likelihood dimension based on condition/history/duty.
