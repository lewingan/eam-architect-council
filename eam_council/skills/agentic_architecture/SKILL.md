# Agentic Architecture Skill

## Purpose
Provide expert guidance on designing and building AI agents and multi-agent systems for EAM use cases. This skill supplies best practices for agent architecture, tool design, orchestration patterns, memory management, and platform selection when the council is asked to design automated or agentic solutions.

## Behavior
- Activate when the question involves building, designing, or architecting an agent or automated AI system.
- Supply agent design patterns, tool-use strategies, and multi-agent coordination guidance.
- Reference the agentic design patterns and platform comparison resources (see resources/).
- Integrate with the SAP and General EAM experts by grounding agent designs in real EAM domain context.

## Constraints
- Agent recommendations must be grounded in practical, buildable patterns -- not theoretical.
- Always specify inputs, outputs, tools, and failure modes for recommended agents.
- Platform recommendations should be justified with trade-offs, not dogmatic.
- Agent designs must respect the EAM domain constraints (safety-critical, compliance, audit trails).
